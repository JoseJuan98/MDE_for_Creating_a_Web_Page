## Planning
As a individual developer I didnâ€™t have a planning, I just carry out with the task when I have time, but I did it in an order, the following one:

1 - Create the Meta-Model

2 - Create OCL restrictions

3 - Create a wrong model for test the OCL restrictions

4 - Create a right model

5 - Create Acceleo Code and test it with the right model

6 - Create the EuGenia editor


And between all task, all time I have to came step behind to change something.
