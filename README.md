## A DSL for modeling workflows and generating process management applications


## Description of the application domain and the project goals
The domain of the project is about an enterprise which needs to implement quickly web site for his business process.

So basically, provide a quick solution for implement basics web services.

## Planning
As a individual developer I didnâ€™t have a planning, I just carry out with the task when I have time, but I did it in an order, the following one:

1- Create the Meta-Model
2- Create OCL restrictions
3- Create a wrong model for test the OCL restrictions
4- Create a right model
5- Create Acceleo Code and test it with the right model
6- Create the EuGenia editor

And between all task, all time I have to came step behind to change something.
